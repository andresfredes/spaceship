# Spaceship
Spaceship battle themed deckbuilder

## Ideas:
- Two alternating modes of play:
    - Space map:
        - Select path
        - Build deck by reacting to events (e.g. alien attack, scavenge wreckage, navigate asteroid belt)
        - Event types:
            - Customise ship (general stats / buffs)
            - Space event
            - Space battle
    - Spaceship battle:
        - Turn based
        - Card selection to perform actions
- Mecahnics to consider:
    - Mana system?
    - Kinds of cards available
    - Kinds of events
    - Customisation of ship - what kinds of options should this provide?
    - Consider mechanics from Artemis (science, navigation, engineering, medical, bridge, fighters, comms, escape pods, weapons, teleporters, storage/loading bay, brig, sleeping quarters)
